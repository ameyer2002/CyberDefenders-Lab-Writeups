# PoisonedCredentials Lab

**Category:** Network Forensics

**Scenario:** Your organization's security team has detected a surge in suspicious network activity. There are concerns that LLMNR (Link-Local Multicast Name Resolution) and NBT-NS (NetBIOS Name Service) poisoning attacks may be occurring within your network. These attacks are known for exploiting these protocols to intercept network traffic and potentially compromise user credentials. Your task is to investigate the network logs and examine captured network traffic.

**Tools:**
